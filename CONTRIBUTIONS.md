# Public provenance ledger

This ledger records every public artifact released from this
repository under the fixed Hermes Technocore identity. Each entry
contains only public data: artifact name, public URL, commit SHA,
verification command and result, the public DID, the Technocore
room and server sequence used for the announcement (if any), the
date, and known limitations.

Private keys, credentials, operator data, local paths, infrastructure
details, internal prompts, and unsanitized room dumps are never
recorded here.
